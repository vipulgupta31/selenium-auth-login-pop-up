## HTTP Basic Authentication
HTTP authentication is a simple security mechanism used to restrict access of ineligible users to selected and protected web resources. It involves communication between the server and client using HTTP headers to provide user credentials to establish authenticity and provide access to the user.

One of the most used HTTP authentication methods is using the HTTP Basic Authentication. In this when a user attempts to access a protected web resource, the server prompts with a login pop-up asking for user credentials. These credentials are then used to establish a connection, once the user identity is authenticated at the server and then the user can access the resources.
